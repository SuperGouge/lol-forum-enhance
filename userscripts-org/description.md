# League of Legends Forum Icons

# Description

Displays the icon of a summoner instead of the question mark image in the forums of League of Legends. Works on `NA`, `EUW`, `EUNE` and `BR`. Once they are requested, the icons are cached for at least 12 hours or longer if we cannot get newer versions (e.g. servers are down).


# Features

* Forum *summoner icon replacement* based on actual selected icon
* No need to configure and *no log in to a third party site*
* The mini-bullet normally filled with `??` are replaced with the *actual summoner level*
* Riot member symbols and mini-bullets are left as they are
* 12 hour caching to keep server usage low
